# Terralith-1.6.5-April-Fools-2022
Stardust Labs 2022 April Fools Pack

This project was written in a python-mcfunction fusion language called bolt! It uses both [beet](https://github.com/mcbeet/beet) and [mecha](https://github.com/mcbeet/mecha) so check out both of those projects!

## Build

To build this project, you must have atleast [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) installed.

```bash
pip install beet mecha
```

Then, to build a datapack, simply run:
```bash
beet
```

Feel free to check out the source, though it was written quite hastily (most of it on a plane).
